          <h3>MTD (Making Tax Digital)</h3>
          <p>In 2015, 85% of self-assessment tax forms within the UK were completed online. It was also in this year that the UK government outlined their plans to ensure all self-assessment forms were completed digitally. To facilitate this change, from April 2022 all VAT-registered businesses that were previously under the turnover threshold (£85,000) will be legally required to complete self-assessment tax forms digitally as part of the Making Tax Digital (MTD) Government scheme. However, this policy does not apply to smaller VAT-registered businesses with turnover less than £10,000.</p>

          <h3>Self Assessment Tax Forms </h3>
          <p>The base form for Self-Assessment in the United Kingdom is the SA100. The SA100 covers the consistent information that applies to all areas of taxation. The SA100 form includes several personal and business financial details, such as: Gross and net taxable profits and pensions or state benefits. All SA100 sections fulfils the basic business data that applies to all businesses. However, there are supplementary forms that are also required to be filled in based on current job or financial status.</p>

          <h3>Brexit</h3>
          <p>When the UK leaves the EU VAT area, it will become a third country. This means that the way businesses manage VAT on goods and services exported and imported to/from the EU will change. Sellers will not charge VAT, but buyers will have to pay VAT to HMRC at the point of import (alongside any applicable customs duties).</p>

          <h3>Invoices & Quotes</h3>
          <p>When a customer pays your invoice, you need to apply their payment to it. This changes the status of the invoice from Outstanding to Paid, or Part Paid if the customer hasn’t paid you the full amount yet. <br> <br> A quote is an exact price for a job that you agree with your customer before starting the work. Your quote should specify precisely the amount and type of work it covers, and the relevant costs.</p>
